## Overview

A simple blog system, compiled at build time into a static Next.js website.  

Stack:
- Next.js
- Tailwind CSS
- DB (one of these)
  - Flat File on Disk (.md)
  - Notion

When you are initializing the project you:
- Decide "BlogPost" custom fields schema and configure it.
- Decide which datasource you want to use, from which blogposts will be fetched, between
  - Flat File on Disk (.md)
  - Notion
- Code in React to customize appearance.

When you have a new blogpost to add:
- Create a new blog post based on datasource
  - FlatFile: Create a new `.md` file inside a specific folder.
  - Notion: Create a new Notion record/page in your Database
- Re-Deploy

## How to bootstrap the project

When you are initializing the project you:
1. Decide "BlogPost" custom fields schema for your and configure it.
2. Decide which datasource you want to use , and from which fetch blogposts, between
  - Flat File on Disk (.md)
  - Notion
3. Code in React to customize appearance.

### 1. Decide "BlogPost" custom fields schema

Edit the zod schema.
Some required fields cannot be deleted or edited, check comments.  
> NOTE: the zod schema is also used to validate every blogposts during build, to be sure you don't forget some fields when you are creating a new blog post.
```ts
// src/data/blog/blog.schema.ts

const blogPostSchema = z.object({
  /** These fields are required! Don't edit unless you know what you are doing */
  slug: z.string(),
  title: z.string(),
  contentAsHTMLString: z.string(),
}).extend({
  /* Add here your front-matter markdown custom fields */
  excerpt: z.string(),
  coverImage: z.string(),
  date: z.string().datetime(),
  author: z.object({
    name: z.string(),
    picture: z.string(),
  }),
});

```

Now thanks to typescript, your React views receive blogposts that are typesafe.

### 2. Decide which datasource you want to use

You must define a `DATASOURCE` env var, that will be used to dynamcally import the desired Datasource Fetching code.  

Depending on datasource type you should provide additional env var. More on this later...  

Follow instructions bases on your Datasource choice.

- [Notion](./src/data/blog/db/notion/README.md)

### 3.Code in React to customize appearance

You know how to do it ðŸ˜œ.  
Pages are in `src/pages` and components used in pages are in `src/views`.
